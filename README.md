# Roll-A-Ball
My first project in Unity! Roll the ball and try to beat all 4 levels!

I made this while on vacation with my parents (I got bored). It was an interesting project that allowed me to put my 3ds Max modelling skills to make levels and combine code to make a simple game. My journey with Unity is still unfinished and I have quite a few ideas that I just need time for!
